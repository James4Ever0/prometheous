# Prometheous

As before, our past is complete chaos because of inadequate knowledge and time for us to learn and develop.

Find tools for searching our code, build a semantic chatbot to serve us, for hacking, earning and creating.

## Data sources

Bookmarks, important code repositories, text files within given suffix and sizes, notes, weblinks, even our actions and clipboards. The bot's actions need to be recorded by its demand.

## Objectives

Assist us by chatting, executing commands in sandboxes and receiving feedback from us and the internet (we may predefine some rewards)

The bot needs to learn and modify itself.

## Requirements

You might want a bigger SSD for storing all these data. It is simply overwhelming. Also for faster searching and training, you may want bigger RAM.
