# Prometheous

As before, our past is complete chaos because of inadequate knowledge and time for us to learn and develop.

Find tools for searching our code, build a semantic chatbot to serve us, for hacking, earning and creating.

## Libraries

You may want to use other models. There are currently [a lot models](https://github.com/eugeneyan/open-llms).

[Baichuan-13B](https://modelscope.cn/models/baichuan-inc/Baichuan-13B-Base)

[ChatGLM2-6B](https://github.com/THUDM/ChatGLM2-6B)

[VisCPM](https://github.com/OpenBMB/VisCPM)

[MPT-6B](https://huggingface.co/mosaicml/mpt-7b-instruct)

[WizardLM](https://github.com/nlpxucan/WizardLM): for coding

[Awesome-LLM-for-RecSys](https://github.com/CHIANGEL/Awesome-LLM-for-RecSys): for recommendation, may assist our "pyjom" project or help model to explore more

## Data sources

Bookmarks, important code repositories, text files within given suffix and sizes, notes, weblinks, even our actions and clipboards. The bot's actions need to be recorded by its demand.

## Objectives

Assist us by chatting, executing commands in sandboxes and receiving feedback from us and the internet (we may predefine some rewards)

The bot needs to learn and modify itself.

## Requirements

You might want a bigger SSD for storing all these data. It is simply overwhelming. Also for faster searching and training, you may want bigger RAM.
