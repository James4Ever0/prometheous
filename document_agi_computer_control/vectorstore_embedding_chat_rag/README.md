how to retrieve documents only related to current file? is that necessary?

with single chunked file we skip the local context fetching step.

is it better to search the whole project?

prefer docarray than llama_index since it is more straightforward.

ask three question only for this file/folder (local context) , and ask three questions about this file/folder and the whole project (global context).
