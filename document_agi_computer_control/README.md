even though we want to document many things, making this tool into some priority based, long term searching (if no query is chosen, set as background task and solve continuously), we have to start from somewhere, like this repository that we have been working for some decent time.

client based semantic searching is just impossible. it takes eternal to load the model and the performance will just be very bad.

---

write-the just provide class/function docstrings. we want the full-code explaination. can we make that happen? or some kind of line-by-line documentation? or from line-by-line explaination to file level explaination, to folder level explaination and so on.

or we would do that later, first make this thing work all over the codebase, and then find a way to connect the dots (webpage).

you need some makeup of the website.

first the search page

next the content browsing page
