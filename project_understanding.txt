scripts are mainly organized using bash

the llm is invoked at llm.py

to control the llm invocation, use the following environment variables:

PROMETHEOUS_MAX_TOKENS
PROMETHEOUS_MODEL_NAME
OPENAI_API_KEY
OPENAI_API_BASE

scripts are bounded to the environment of the development machine

using custom python version "python3.9" and a special binary "ntfy_error"

all python package versions are unspecified in "requirements.txt", so you may have to retrieve relevent versions from the development machine

build_extra.sh > build_doc_custom.sh
